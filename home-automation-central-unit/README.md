#Central Unit
The “brain” of the whole system, taking the decision accordingly to the environment and the orders from the control panel.

It interacts with the Arduino using serial ports.

To make it receive the data from the control panel, we call one of its function. To let it sends to the control panel, we give it one function to call. The program which then transmits properly the data will depend on how the connection is made.

#Dependencies
Tkinter and PySerial, last version.
