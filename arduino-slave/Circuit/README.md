[Link to the last version of the circuit in Tinkercad.](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/btyXOP10x8g-jean-michel-volet-roulant/editel)

In this folder you can find the **BRD file** of the whole circuit and annoted **PNGs** (because the BRD file doesn't have any annotation), in order to view and understand the circuit.
These files may not be updated immediately after each change in Tinkercad.
