# Interface
This will simulate the end-user interface and the connection with the command-unit (here it is with COM ports, emulated through Virtual Series Port Tool from HHD Software).
A schema explains how the interface would looks like in reality and how it would be connected to the command-unit. A protocol will be defined for the communication between the command interface and the central command unit.
It will also gives something to emulate the Arduino slave, sending data (that you can change) and displaying the order received from the command-unit, telling wether the curtains are opened or not.
